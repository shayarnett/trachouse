NOTES
-----

You'll need to get lighthouse.rb from
http://ar-code.svn.engineyard.com/lighthouse-api/lib

Enter Lighthouse and Trac configuration data in the ###marked### sections.

Usage:

    require 'trachouse'

    t = Ticket.new

    # grabs all tickets from trac
    tickets = t.populate_tickets
    # import tickets to lighthouse
    t.import_tickets(tickets)
    # profit

You may want to inspect tickets and import a subset for testing, before
bulk processing all tickets.
